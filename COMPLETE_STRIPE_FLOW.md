---

## üîÅ Payment Initialization & Validation

### When Rider Selects Stripe

**Location:** `booking_details_screen.dart` ‚Üí `_handleStripeSelection()`

**Flow:**
1. User taps "Stripe" in payment method dialog
2. System validates route is calculated
3. Calculates total amount (fare + taxes)
4. Creates Stripe payment intent with manual capture
5. Presents Stripe payment sheet

**Possible Outcomes:**

#### ‚úÖ Success - Card Authorized
```dart
- Payment intent ID stored
- Authorized amount stored
- Payment method selected
- Toast shown with hold details
```

**User Notification:**
```
"$25.50 is currently on hold. You'll only be charged the final
amount once the ride is complete. Any unused amount will be
returned to your payment method."
```
- Duration: 5 seconds
- Position: Center
- Builds trust and transparency

#### ‚ùå Failure - Card Declined / Insufficient Funds
```dart
- Payment method NOT selected
- Payment intent data cleared
- User shown error message
```

**User Notification:**
```
"Insufficient funds. Please check your payment method."
```

#### ‚ùå Failure - User Cancels Payment Sheet
```dart
- Payment method NOT selected
- Payment intent data cleared
- User shown error message
```

**User Notification:**
```
"Insufficient funds. Please check your payment method."
```

**Code Implementation:**
```dart
if (paymentResult != null) {
  // Success
  controller.stripePaymentIntentId.value = paymentIntentId;
  controller.stripePreAuthAmount.value = totalAmount;
  controller.selectedPaymentMethod.value = "Stripe";

  ShowToastDialog.showToast(
    "${amount} is currently on hold. You'll only be charged...",
    position: EasyLoadingToastPosition.center,
    duration: const Duration(seconds: 5)
  );
} else {
  // Failure or Cancel
  controller.selectedPaymentMethod.value = "";
  controller.stripePaymentIntentId.value = "";
  controller.stripePreAuthAmount.value = "";

  ShowToastDialog.showToast(
    "Insufficient funds. Please check your payment method."
  );
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Instant Booking Validation

**Location:** `booking_details_screen.dart` ‚Üí `_handleInstantBooking()`

### Validation Logic

**For Wallet:**
```dart
if (walletBalance < payableAmount) {
  ShowToastDialog.showToast(
    "Insufficient funds. Please check your payment method."
  );
  return; // Block booking
}
```

**For Stripe:**
```dart
// Check 1: Payment intent exists
if (stripePaymentIntentId.isEmpty) {
  ShowToastDialog.showToast(
    "Insufficient funds. Please check your payment method."
  );
  return; // Block booking
}

// Check 2: Authorized amount sufficient
if (authorizedAmount < payableAmount) {
  ShowToastDialog.showToast(
    "Insufficient funds. Please check your payment method."
  );
  return; // Block booking
}

// All checks passed - proceed with instant booking
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ Same validation for both booking methods
- ‚úÖ Checks authorization exists
- ‚úÖ Verifies amount is sufficient
- ‚úÖ Prevents QR code generation without valid payment
- ‚úÖ User must top up or change payment method

---

## üí≥ Regular Booking Flow

**Location:** `home_controller.dart` ‚Üí `bookRide()`

### Stripe Validation During Booking

```dart
if (selectedPaymentMethod == "Stripe") {
  if (stripePaymentIntentId.isEmpty) {
    ShowToastDialog.showToast(
      "Please select Stripe payment method again to authorize payment"
    );
    return false;
  }

  // Use stored payment intent
  orderModel.paymentIntentId = stripePaymentIntentId;
  orderModel.preAuthAmount = stripePreAuthAmount;
  orderModel.paymentIntentStatus = 'requires_capture';
  orderModel.preAuthCreatedAt = Timestamp.now();
}
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Hold is placed
- ‚úÖ Ride is booked
- ‚úÖ No new payment sheet shown
- ‚úÖ Driver can accept

---

## ‚ùå Ride Cancellation After Driver Acceptance

**Location:** `payment_order_controller.dart` ‚Üí `handleRideCancellation()`

### Cancellation Flow

**When Called:**
- User cancels ride after driver accepts
- Before pickup begins

**Process:**
```dart
1. Retrieves payment intent ID from order
2. Calls Stripe API to cancel payment intent
   POST /payment_intents/{id}/cancel
3. Updates order status to 'cancelled'
4. Updates ride status to cancelled
5. Saves to Firestore
6. Shows confirmation to user
```

**Stripe API Call:**
```dart
final stripeService = StripeService(
  stripeSecret: config.stripeSecret,
  publishableKey: config.publishableKey,
);

final success = await stripeService.releasePreAuthorization(
  paymentIntentId: orderModel.paymentIntentId
);
```

**Success Result:**
```dart
- Order status: 'cancelled'
- Payment intent status: 'cancelled'
- Hold released (money back to card)
- User notified
```

**User Notification:**
```
"Ride canceled. Your payment hold has been released."
```
- Duration: 4 seconds
- Position: Center

**Important Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No charge is applied (unless cancellation fees configured)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hold is released immediately via Stripe API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Funds return to card within 5-7 business days
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User sees confirmation immediately

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Payment Handling at Ride Completion

**Location:** `payment_order_controller.dart` ‚Üí `_captureStripePreAuthorization()`

### Completion Flow

**When Called:**
- Ride is completed
- User navigates to payment screen
- Clicks "Complete Payment"

**Process:**

#### Step 1: Validate Pre-Authorization
```dart
if (orderModel.paymentIntentId == null) {
  // No pre-auth, fall back to new payment
  return;
}
```

#### Step 2: Calculate Final Fare
```dart
final finalAmount = calculateAmount(); // Distance + time + taxes - coupon
```

#### Step 3: Capture from Hold
```dart
final captureResult = await stripeService.capturePreAuthorization(
  paymentIntentId: orderModel.paymentIntentId,
  finalAmount: finalAmount.toStringAsFixed(2),
);
```

**Stripe API Call:**
```
POST /payment_intents/{id}/capture
Body: {
  amount_to_capture: finalAmount * 100 (in cents)
}
```

#### Step 4: Handle Capture Result

**If Successful:**
```dart
// Update order
orderModel.paymentIntentStatus = 'captured';
orderModel.paymentStatus = true;
orderModel.status = Constant.rideComplete;

// Create transaction record
WalletTransactionModel stripeTransaction = {
  id: uuid,
  amount: finalAmount,
  paymentType: "Stripe",
  transactionId: orderId,
  userId: customerId,
  note: "Stripe payment captured - Ride ID: xxx"
};

// Save to Firestore
await FireStoreUtils.setWalletTransaction(stripeTransaction);
await FireStoreUtils.setOrder(orderModel);

// Notify user
if (finalAmount < authorizedAmount) {
  // Partial capture - some returned
  difference = authorizedAmount - finalAmount;
  ShowToastDialog.showToast(
    "Payment of $finalAmount captured successfully.
    $difference returned to your card."
  );
} else {
  // Full capture
  ShowToastDialog.showToast(
    "Payment of $finalAmount captured successfully."
  );
}
```

**If Failed:**
```dart
ShowToastDialog.showToast(
  "Payment capture failed. Please contact support."
);
```

#### Step 5: Automatic Hold Release

**Stripe automatically handles:**
- If `finalAmount < authorizedAmount` ‚Üí Difference released
- If `finalAmount = authorizedAmount` ‚Üí Full amount captured
- If `finalAmount > authorizedAmount` ‚Üí Capture fails (can't exceed hold)

**Example:**
```
Hold placed: $30.00
Final fare: $24.50
Captured: $24.50
Released: $5.50 (automatic by Stripe)
```
