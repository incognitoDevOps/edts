# Stripe Payment Authorization - Final Implementation

## Overview

Complete implementation of Stripe payment authorization with proper validation, error handling, and transaction history.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Authorization Required Before Booking
- Payment authorization happens when Stripe is selected
- If user cancels authorization → Shows "Insufficient balance"
- If card declined → Shows "Insufficient balance"
- Payment method NOT selected unless authorization succeeds
- Booking button disabled without valid payment authorization

### 2. ✅ Balance Validation
**For Regular Booking:**
- Wallet: Checks wallet balance before booking
- Stripe: Validates payment intent ID exists
- Shows "Insufficient balance" if validation fails

**For Instant Booking:**
- Wallet: Checks wallet balance
- Stripe: Validates payment intent ID exists
- Stripe: Verifies authorized amount covers total
- Prevents QR code generation without valid payment

### 3. ✅ No Double Payment
- Payment intent created once during selection
- ID stored in controller
- Complete Ride screen checks for existing intent
- If intent exists → Captures from authorization
- If no intent → Falls back to new payment
- Shows "Payment Pre-Authorized ✓" indicator

### 4. ✅ Transaction History
- Creates wallet transaction record on capture
- Includes ride ID in transaction note
- Stores payment type as "Stripe"
- Records exact amount captured
- User can see in payment history
- Proper order status updates

## Implementation Details

### File: booking_details_screen.dart

**Authorization on Payment Selection:**
```dart
Future<void> _handleStripeSelection() async {
  // Validates route calculated
  // Calculates total amount
  // Initializes Stripe SDK
  // Creates payment intent
  // Presents payment sheet

  // On Success:
  - Stores payment intent ID
  - Stores authorized amount
  - Sets payment method
  - Shows success toast

  // On Failure/Cancel:
  - Clears payment method
  - Clears payment intent data
  - Shows "Insufficient balance"
}
```

**Instant Booking Validation:**
```dart
// Validates Stripe authorization
if (stripe selected) {
  if (no payment intent) {
    Show "Insufficient balance"
    Return
  }
  if (authorized amount < required) {
    Show "Insufficient balance"
    Return
  }
}
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- Green checkmark when authorized
- "Payment Authorized" text
- Helps user confirm payment ready

### File: home_controller.dart

**New Fields:**
```dart
RxString stripePaymentIntentId = "".obs;
RxString stripePreAuthAmount = "".obs;
```

**Booking Process:**
```dart
if (Stripe selected) {
  if (no payment intent ID) {
    Show error
    Return false
  }
  // Use stored payment intent
  orderModel.paymentIntentId = stripePaymentIntentId
  orderModel.preAuthAmount = stripePreAuthAmount
  orderModel.paymentIntentStatus = 'requires_capture'
}
```

**Cleanup After Booking:**
```dart
// Clears form data
stripePaymentIntentId.value = ""
stripePreAuthAmount.value = ""
```

### File: payment_order_screen.dart

**Payment Method Display:**
```dart
if (Stripe && has payment intent) {
  Show "Payment Pre-Authorized ✓"
}
```

**Payment Handler:**
```dart
case 'stripe':
  if (has payment intent ID) {
    // Capture from authorization
    controller.capturePreAuthorization()
  } else {
    // Create new payment
    controller.stripeMakePayment()
  }
```

### File: payment_order_controller.dart

**Capture with Transaction History:**
```dart
Future<void> _captureStripePreAuthorization() async {
  // Calculates final amount
  // Captures from authorization

  if (success) {
    // Update order status
    orderModel.paymentIntentStatus = 'captured'
    orderModel.paymentStatus = true

    // Create transaction record
    WalletTransactionModel stripeTransaction = {
      amount: finalAmount,
      paymentType: "Stripe",
      transactionId: orderId,
      userId: currentUserId,
      note: "Stripe payment captured - Ride ID: xxx"
    }

    // Save transaction
    await FireStoreUtils.setWalletTransaction()
    await FireStoreUtils.setOrder()
  }
}
```
