# Stripe Payment Capture Fix - Implementation Summary

## Critical Issue Identified

**Problem:** Rider cards were being pre-authorized but payments remained "Uncaptured" in Stripe, causing financial losses and customer confusion.

**Root Cause:** The `_captureStripePreAuthorization()` method was called conditionally and could fail silently without blocking order completion.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Capture Method (Primary Fix)

**File:** `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart`

**Changes:**
- Made `_captureStripePreAuthorization()` return `bool` (success/failure)
- Added automatic retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Added comprehensive status checking before capture
- Implemented proper error logging to Firebase
- Created transaction records for audit trail
- Added "already captured" detection to prevent duplicate charges

**Impact:** ✅ Guarantees capture attempt or explicit failure notification

### 2. Mandatory Capture Check (Critical Fix)

**File:** `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart` (lines 918-942)

**Changes:**
- Modified `completeOrder()` to **block** order completion until capture succeeds
- Added explicit error handling for capture failures
- Set order status to "Payment Pending Review" on failure
- Prevented silent failures that caused the original issue

**Impact:** ✅ Orders cannot complete without successful payment capture

### 3. Automatic Recovery System

**New File:** `lib/services/auto_capture_service.dart`

**Features:**
- Background service runs every 15 minutes
- Finds uncaptured payments from last 24 hours
- Attempts automatic capture with rate limiting
- Logs all successes and failures
- Batch processing with status reporting

**Impact:** ✅ Automatically recovers failed captures without manual intervention

**Initialization:** Added to `lib/main.dart` (line 26)

### 4. Admin Management Interface

**New File:** `lib/admin/uncaptured_payments_screen.dart`

**Features:**
- Real-time list of all uncaptured payments
- One-click manual capture for individual orders
- Bulk capture operation
- Order details display
- Status monitoring

**Usage:**
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => UncapturedPaymentsScreen()),
);
```

**Impact:** ✅ Provides admin tools to monitor and manually resolve uncaptured payments

### 5. Monitoring & Metrics System

**New File:** `lib/services/payment_capture_monitor.dart`

**Features:**
- Capture success rate tracking
- Daily/monthly reports
- Failed capture logs
- Real-time alerts for thresholds
- Stream-based monitoring

**Impact:** ✅ Provides visibility into payment capture health

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart` - Core capture logic
2. ✅ `lib/main.dart` - Initialize auto-capture service

## Files Created

1. ✅ `lib/services/auto_capture_service.dart` - Automatic retry service
2. ✅ `lib/admin/uncaptured_payments_screen.dart` - Admin UI
3. ✅ `lib/services/payment_capture_monitor.dart` - Metrics & monitoring
4. ✅ `STRIPE_CAPTURE_FIX.md` - Complete documentation
5. ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Firebase Collections Created

1. **`capture_failures`** - Logs failed capture attempts
2. **`auto_capture_log`** - Logs successful auto-captures
3. **`auto_capture_batches`** - Batch processing statistics
4. **`capture_attempts`** - Complete capture history

## How It Works Now

### Normal Flow (Success)
```
1. Customer completes ride
2. completeOrder() called
3. Detects Stripe payment
4. _captureStripePreAuthorization() executes
5. Capture succeeds on attempt 1
6. Transaction logged
7. Order status updated to "Ride Complete"
8. Driver receives payment
```

### Failure Flow (Network Issue)
```
1. Customer completes ride
2. completeOrder() called
3. Detects Stripe payment
4. _captureStripePreAuthorization() executes
5. Attempt 1 fails (network timeout)
6. Wait 2 seconds, retry
7. Attempt 2 succeeds
8. Transaction logged
9. Order completes normally
```

### Critical Failure Flow (All Retries Fail)
```
1. Customer completes ride
2. completeOrder() called
3. Detects Stripe payment
4. _captureStripePreAuthorization() executes
5. All 3 attempts fail
6. Failure logged to Firebase
7. Order status set to "Payment Pending Review"
8. Customer shown error message
9. Order NOT marked as complete
10. Auto-capture service will retry in 15 minutes
```

### Auto-Recovery Flow
```
Every 15 minutes:
1. Auto-capture service runs
2. Finds orders with status "requires_capture"
3. Filters to orders < 24 hours old
4. Attempts capture for each order
5. Successful captures update order status
6. Failed captures logged for admin review
7. Statistics recorded
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment

1. **Test Successful Capture**
   - Complete a ride with Stripe payment
   - Verify payment captured in Stripe dashboard
   - Confirm order status is "Ride Complete"
   - Check transaction record created

2. **Test Retry Logic**
   - Temporarily disable network
   - Complete a ride
   - Verify retry attempts in logs
   - Re-enable network mid-retry
   - Confirm eventual success

3. **Test Failure Handling**
   - Use test payment intent that fails
   - Complete a ride
   - Verify error message shown
   - Confirm order status is "Payment Pending Review"
   - Check failure logged to Firebase

4. **Test Auto-Capture Service**
   - Create order with "requires_capture" status
   - Wait for service to run (or trigger manually)
   - Verify order captured automatically
   - Check auto-capture logs

5. **Test Admin Screen**
   - Open UncapturedPaymentsScreen
   - Verify list shows pending orders
   - Test manual capture button
   - Test bulk capture feature
   - Verify refresh functionality

### After Deployment

1. **Monitor for 48 hours**
   ```dart
   final metrics = await PaymentCaptureMonitor.getCaptureMetrics();
   print("Capture rate: ${metrics['captureRate']}%");
   ```

2. **Check failure logs daily**
   ```dart
   final failures = await PaymentCaptureMonitor.getCaptureFailures();
   // Review and address any patterns
   ```

3. **Verify auto-capture effectiveness**
   ```dart
   final status = await AutoCaptureService.getServiceStatus();
   print("Success rate: ${status['successRate']}%");
   ```

## Recovery Plan for Existing Uncaptured Payments

### Immediate Action (Do First)

1. **Access Admin Screen**
   ```dart
   // Add to app navigation or settings
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => UncapturedPaymentsScreen()),
   );
   ```

2. **Review Uncaptured List**
   - See all pending captures
   - Note total amount at risk
   - Identify any patterns

3. **Bulk Capture**
   - Click "Bulk Capture" button
   - Wait for processing
   - Review success/failure counts

### Verification

1. **Check Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to Payments → Filter "Uncaptured"
   - Should see significant reduction
   - Cross-reference any remaining with Firebase

2. **Verify Firebase**
   ```dart
   final uncaptured = await PaymentCaptureMonitor.getUncapturedOrders();
   print("Remaining uncaptured: ${uncaptured.length}");
   ```

3. **Manual Review**
   - For any remaining uncaptured payments
   - Investigate individual cases
   - May need manual intervention in Stripe

## Configuration Settings

### Auto-Capture Interval
**Location:** `lib/main.dart` line 26
**Default:** 15 minutes
**Recommendation:** Keep at 15 minutes for responsive recovery

### Retry Attempts
**Location:** `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart`
**Default:** 3 attempts
**Recommendation:** Keep at 3 to balance speed and reliability

### Uncaptured Age Limit
**Location:** `lib/services/auto_capture_service.dart`
**Default:** 24 hours
**Recommendation:** Keep at 24 hours (Stripe allows up to 7 days)

   - Remove mandatory capture check

3. **Manual Processing**
   - Use admin screen to manually capture
   - Process critical orders first

4. **Investigation**
   - Review logs to identify issue
   - Fix and test in staging
   - Redeploy when resolved

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: High Failure Rate

**Check:**
- Stripe API key configuration
- Network connectivity
- Firestore permissions
- Payment intent expiration times

**Debug:**
```dart
// Enable detailed logging
print("🔍 Order: ${order.id}");
print("💳 Payment Intent: ${order.paymentIntentId}");
print("📊 Status: ${order.paymentIntentStatus}");
print("💰 Amount: ${order.finalRate}");
```

### Issue: Auto-Capture Not Running

**Verify:**
```dart
final status = await AutoCaptureService.getServiceStatus();
print("Running: ${status['isRunning']}");
```

**Fix:**
```dart
AutoCaptureService.stopAutoCapture();
await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
AutoCaptureService.startAutoCapture();
```

### Issue: Duplicate Captures

**Protection:** Already built-in
- Status checked before capture
- "Already captured" errors handled gracefully
- Transaction deduplication by payment intent ID
