   - Cancel before completion
   - Verify hold is released
   - Check confirmation message

4. **Amount Variations:**
   - Test when final fare > estimated fare
   - Test when final fare < estimated fare
   - Verify correct amounts captured

5. **Edge Cases:**

   - Multiple rapid booking attempts
   - Switching payment methods

## Configuration Required

       }
     }
     ```
