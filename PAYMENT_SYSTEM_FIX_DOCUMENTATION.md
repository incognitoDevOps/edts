# 🔧 Payment System Fix - Complete Documentation

## 🎯 Problem Summary

**Issue**: Payment intents created during booking were not being properly captured at ride completion, causing funds to remain held on customer cards without being transferred.

**Impact**:
- 7 payments stuck as "Uncaptured" in Stripe (~CA$12.65 total)
- Canceled rides not releasing pre-authorized amounts
- Wallet amounts showing inconsistently
- Payment screen requiring reloads

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Emergency Capture Tool
**File**: `lib/admin/emergency_capture_tool.dart`

**Purpose**: Immediately capture stuck payments manually

**Features**:
- Lists all uncaptured payments with details
- Single payment capture with confirmation
- Batch capture all payments with progress tracking
- Real-time status updates
- Automatic retry on failure

**Usage**:
```dart
// Navigate to the emergency capture tool
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => EmergencyCaptureToolScreen(),
  ),
);
```

**To Capture Stuck Payments**:
1. Open the Emergency Capture Tool screen
2. Review the 7 uncaptured payments listed
3. Click "Capture All" to process all at once, OR
4. Click individual payment's capture button for manual control
5. Confirm the action
6. Wait for processing (with retry logic built-in)
7. Verify success messages

---

### 2. Payment Intent Data Validation
**File**: `lib/controller/home_controller.dart` (Lines 509-525)

**Changes**:
```dart
// CRITICAL: Store payment intent data with validation
orderModel.paymentIntentId = stripePaymentIntentId.value;
orderModel.preAuthAmount = stripePreAuthAmount.value;
orderModel.paymentIntentStatus = 'requires_capture';
orderModel.preAuthCreatedAt = Timestamp.now();

// VALIDATION: Ensure payment intent data is set
if (orderModel.paymentIntentId == null || orderModel.paymentIntentId!.isEmpty) {
  print("❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Payment intent ID is empty!");
  ShowToastDialog.showToast("Payment authorization error. Please try again.");
  return false;
}
```

**Purpose**: Prevents booking from completing if payment intent data is missing

---

### 3. Enhanced Payment Capture with Retry Logic
**File**: `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart` (Lines 300-409)

**Features**:
- Automatic retry up to 3 attempts
- Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s)
- Network timeout handling (30s per attempt)
- Retryable vs non-retryable error detection
- Automatic failure logging to Firestore

**Error Handling**:
```dart
// Retryable errors:
- "network"
- "timeout"
- "connection"
- "temporarily unavailable"
- "rate limit"

// Non-retryable errors:
- "insufficient_funds"
- "card_declined"
- "invalid_payment_intent"
```

---

### 4. Cancellation Refund Processing
**File**: `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart` (Lines 862-1027)

**Features**:
- Automatic Stripe pre-authorization release
- Retry logic for failed cancellations (3 attempts)
- Wallet refunds for completed payments
- Transaction history logging
- User notifications with amounts

**Cancellation Flow**:
1. User cancels ride
2. System checks payment status
3. If Stripe & not captured → Release hold
4. If Wallet & captured → Refund to wallet
5. Create transaction record
6. Update order status
7. Notify user of refund

---

### 5. Payment Monitoring Dashboard
**File**: `lib/admin/payment_monitoring_dashboard.dart`

**Features**:
- Real-time statistics (last 30 days)
- Total orders count
- Uncaptured payments count & amount
- Captured payments count & amount
- Canceled payments count
- List of recent uncaptured payments
- Visual alerts for action items
- Pull-to-refresh

**Metrics Displayed**:
- ✅ Total Orders
- ⚠️ Uncaptured (with total amount)
- ✅ Captured (with total amount)
- 🚫 Canceled

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Capture Stuck Payments (URGENT)
```bash
# Option A: Use Emergency Capture Tool (Recommended)
1. Build and run the app
2. Navigate to Emergency Capture Tool
3. Click "Capture All"
4. Wait for completion
5. Verify in Stripe Dashboard

# Option B: Manual Stripe Dashboard
1. Login to Stripe Dashboard
2. Go to Payments → Uncaptured
3. Manually capture each payment:
   - pi_3SGhcFKJpn8yBEHM1aW3irnr
   - pi_3SGGgVKJpn8yBEHM1c296Xcc
   - pi_3SGFPhKJpn8yBEHM0ICfCVJI
   - pi_3SGEzkKJpn8yBEHM0Zk2he40
   - pi_3SG3i1KJpn8yBEHM1mf2J5zJ
   - pi_3SFuoxKJpn8yBEHM0yQuK7d4
   - pi_3SFtzFKJpn8yBEHM1zkw86zn
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Code
```bash
# Flutter build
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release  # Android
flutter build ios --release  # iOS

# Test on staging environment first
# Verify all test cases pass
# Deploy to production
```

### Step 3: Monitor for 48 Hours
```bash
# Check monitoring dashboard daily
# Watch for:
- New uncaptured payments
- Failed captures in Firestore collection 'capture_failures'
- User complaints about payments
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Key Firestore Collections to Monitor:

#### 1. `capture_failures` Collection
```javascript
{
  orderId: "order_123",
  paymentIntentId: "pi_xxx",
  error: "network timeout",
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  userId: "user_123",
  amount: "10.50",
  preAuthAmount: "12.00",
  paymentIntentStatus: "requires_capture"
}
```

#### 2. `walletTransaction` Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "txn_123",
  amount: "0",  // 0 for cancellations
  paymentType: "Stripe",
  note: "Ride cancelled - Stripe pre-authorization released...",
  createdDate: Timestamp
}
```

### Log Messages to Watch:

**Success Messages**:
```
✅ Payment captured successfully on attempt X!
✅ Pre-authorization released successfully on attempt X
✅ Payment intent data validated and stored
```

**Warning Messages**:
```
⚠️ createPreAuthorization called - This should not happen!
❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Payment intent ID is empty!
❌ Capture attempt X failed
```

### Stripe Dashboard Checks:
1. **Payments** → Filter by "Uncaptured" → Should be 0
2. **Payments** → Filter by "Succeeded" → Verify recent captures
3. **Payments** → Filter by "Canceled" → Verify cancellations
4. **Balance** → Verify pending balance is accurate

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Payment Still Not Capturing

**Diagnosis**:
```dart
// Check logs for:
print("💰 Capturing payment intent: ${orderModel.value.paymentIntentId}");
print("💰 Amount to capture: $amount");

// If paymentIntentId is null:
// Problem: Payment intent not saved during booking
// Solution: Check home_controller.dart validation (line 510)

// If paymentIntentId exists but capture fails:
// Problem: Stripe API error
// Solution: Check Stripe Dashboard for payment intent status
```

**Fix**:
1. Check `capture_failures` collection in Firestore
2. Find the failed order
3. Copy paymentIntentId
4. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Search for payment intent
5. Check status and error messages
6. Use Emergency Capture Tool to retry

---

### Issue: Cancellation Not Releasing Funds

**Diagnosis**:
```dart
// Check logs for:
print("🔄 Cancelling Stripe pre-authorization...");
print("✅ Pre-authorization released successfully");

// If release fails:
// Problem: Payment intent already captured or expired
// Solution: Check Stripe Dashboard
```

**Fix**:
1. Check if payment is captured (status = succeeded)
2. If captured, process refund through Stripe Dashboard
3. If expired (>7 days), funds auto-released
4. Update order status manually in Firestore

---

### Issue: Monitoring Dashboard Shows Wrong Numbers

**Diagnosis**:
- Dashboard queries last 30 days only
- Filters by `paymentType == 'Stripe'`
- Checks `paymentIntentId` is not null

**Fix**:
```dart
// Rebuild query in payment_monitoring_dashboard.dart (line 31)
// Adjust date range if needed
final last30Days = now.subtract(const Duration(days: 30));
```
