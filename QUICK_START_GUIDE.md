## ⚡ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. URGENT: Capture 7 Stuck Payments (5 minutes)

**Using Emergency Capture Tool**:
```dart

// 2. Navigate to the tool
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => EmergencyCaptureToolScreen()),
);

// 3. Click "Capture All" button (top right)
// 4. Confirm action
// 5. Wait for completion (~30 seconds)
```

**OR Manually in Stripe Dashboard**:
1. Login: https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Payments → Filter "Uncaptured"
3. Click each payment → "Capture payment"
4. Repeat for all 7 payments

- ✅ Network timeout handling
- ✅ Error logging
- ✅ Transaction history

### 2. Cancellations Now Release Funds
- ✅ Automatic pre-auth release
- ✅ Retry on failure
- ✅ User notifications
- ✅ Transaction records

### 3. Data Validation Added
- ✅ Payment intent ID required
- ✅ Pre-auth amount validation
- ✅ Prevents incomplete bookings

### 4. Monitoring Tools Created
- ✅ Emergency capture tool
- ✅ Payment monitoring dashboard
- ✅ Real-time statistics

## ✅ Testing Quick Checklist

Run these tests before production:

### Test 1: New Booking (2 minutes)
```
1. Create booking with Stripe
2. Check logs for "✅ Payment intent data validated"
3. Complete ride
4. Verify payment captured
5. Check Stripe Dashboard
```

### Test 2: Cancellation (2 minutes)
```
1. Create booking with Stripe
2. Cancel immediately
3. Check logs for "✅ Pre-authorization released"
4. Verify notification to user
5. Check Stripe Dashboard
```

### Test 3: Emergency Tool (1 minute)
```
1. Open Emergency Capture Tool
2. Verify list loads
3. Click single capture (test payment)
4. Verify success message
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "Payment intent not found"
**Cause**: Old booking before fix
**Fix**: Use Emergency Capture Tool

### Issue: "Stripe not configured"
**Cause**: Missing Stripe keys in Firebase
**Fix**: Check Settings → Payment → Stripe configuration

### Issue: Capture fails repeatedly
**Cause**: Payment intent expired (>7 days)
**Fix**: Funds auto-released, just update order status

---

## 📊 Monitoring (Daily)

### Check These Metrics:
```dart
// Open Payment Monitoring Dashboard
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => PaymentMonitoringDashboard()),
);

// Look for:
✅ Uncaptured: Should be 0
✅ Captured: Should increase daily
⚠️ Red alerts: Investigate immediately
```

### Check Firestore:
- Collection: `capture_failures` → Should be empty
- Collection: `walletTransaction` → Should show all payments

---

## 🔧 Code Changes Summary

### Before:
```dart
// Payment capture had no retry
final result = await stripe.capture(paymentIntentId);

// No validation
orderModel.paymentIntentId = stripePaymentIntentId.value;

// No cancellation refunds
// Missing implementation
```

### After:
```dart
// Payment capture with 3 retries
for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= 3; attempt++) {
  final result = await stripe.capture(paymentIntentId);
  if (success) break;
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: attempt * 2));
}

// With validation
if (paymentIntentId == null || paymentIntentId.isEmpty) {
  return false; // Prevent booking
}

// Cancellation refunds
await stripe.cancel(paymentIntentId);
await recordTransaction(...);
ShowToast("Funds released");
```
