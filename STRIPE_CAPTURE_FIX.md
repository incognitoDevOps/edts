# Stripe Payment Capture Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem Summary

Rider cards were being charged (pre-authorized) but payments remained "Uncaptured" in Stripe dashboard, causing:
- Funds held on customer cards but not transferred to merchant
- Transaction history showing $0.00 amounts
- Financial reconciliation issues
- Poor customer experience

## Root Cause

The payment capture workflow had a critical gap:
1. ✅ Pre-authorization created during booking (working)
2. ✅ Driver completes ride (working)
3. ❌ **Capture not executed reliably** (BROKEN)
4. ❌ Funds remain on hold indefinitely

### Specific Issues

1. **`_captureStripePreAuthorization()` was a fallback only**
   - Called conditionally in `completeOrder()`
   - Not guaranteed to execute
   - No retry mechanism
   - Silent failures

2. **Missing capture verification**
   - No status checks before capture
   - No logging of failures
   - No admin alerts

3. **No recovery mechanisms**
   - Failed captures not tracked
   - No automatic retries
   - No manual admin tools

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Guaranteed Capture Flow

**Enhanced `_captureStripePreAuthorization()` method:**
- ✅ Returns `bool` to indicate success/failure
- ✅ Checks payment intent status before capture
- ✅ Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- ✅ Handles already-captured payments gracefully
- ✅ Logs all failures to Firebase for admin review
- ✅ Creates proper transaction records

**Location:** `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart` (lines 1134-1330)

### 2. Mandatory Capture Check

**Updated `completeOrder()` method:**
- ✅ Blocks order completion until capture succeeds
- ✅ Shows clear error messages to customers
- ✅ Marks orders for manual review if capture fails
- ✅ Prevents "Ride Complete" status without payment capture

**Location:** `lib/controller/payment_order_controller.dart` (lines 918-942)

### 3. Auto-Recovery System

**`AutoCaptureService`** - Background service that:
- ✅ Runs every 15 minutes automatically
- ✅ Finds all uncaptured payments from last 24 hours
- ✅ Attempts automatic capture with rate limiting
- ✅ Logs all successes and failures
- ✅ Prevents duplicate capture attempts

**Location:** `lib/services/auto_capture_service.dart`

**Initialization:** `lib/main.dart` (line 26)

### 4. Admin Management Interface

**`UncapturedPaymentsScreen`** provides:
- ✅ Real-time list of all uncaptured payments
- ✅ One-click manual capture for individual orders
- ✅ Bulk capture operation for multiple orders
- ✅ Detailed payment information display
- ✅ Status monitoring and refresh

**Location:** `lib/admin/uncaptured_payments_screen.dart`

### 5. Monitoring & Metrics

**`PaymentCaptureMonitor`** tracks:
- ✅ Capture success rate
- ✅ Total captured vs uncaptured amounts
- ✅ Failed capture attempts
- ✅ Daily/monthly reports
- ✅ Real-time alerts when uncaptured threshold exceeded

**Location:** `lib/services/payment_capture_monitor.dart`

## Implementation Details

### Capture Workflow

```dart
// 1. Customer completes ride
completeOrder() {
  // 2. Check if Stripe payment
  if (isStripePayment) {
    // 3. MANDATORY capture (blocks completion)
    final success = await _captureStripePreAuthorization();

    if (!success) {
      // 4. Capture failed - show error & log
      ShowToast("Payment capture failed");
      await _logCaptureFailure();
      orderModel.status = "Payment Pending Review";
      return; // STOP - don't complete order
    }
  }

  // 5. Capture succeeded - continue with completion
  // Process driver payment, send notifications, etc.
}
```

### Retry Logic

```dart
_captureWithRetry() {
  for (attempt = 1 to 3) {
    result = await stripeService.capturePreAuthorization();

    if (result.success) return result;

    if (error is "already captured") return success;

    if (!isRetryable(error)) return failure;

    await delay(attempt * 2 seconds);
  }

  return failure;
}
```

### Auto-Capture Service

```dart
// Runs every 15 minutes
AutoCaptureService.startAutoCapture(interval: 15 minutes)

// Find uncaptured payments from last 24 hours
orders = getOrders(status: "requires_capture", age: "< 24 hours")

// Attempt capture for each order
for (order in orders) {
  result = await capturePayment(order)

  if (result.success) {
    markOrderAsCompleted(order)
    logSuccess(order)
  } else {
    logFailure(order, error)
  }
}
```

## Firebase Collections

### New Collections Created

1. **`capture_failures`**
   - Tracks all failed capture attempts
   - Fields: orderId, paymentIntentId, error, timestamp, userId, amount

2. **`auto_capture_log`**
   - Logs successful auto-captures
   - Fields: orderId, paymentIntentId, amount, timestamp

3. **`auto_capture_batches`**
   - Records batch processing statistics
   - Fields: totalProcessed, successCount, failCount, timestamp

4. **`capture_attempts`**
   - All capture attempt history
   - Fields: orderId, paymentIntentId, success, error, amount, timestamp

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test `_captureStripePreAuthorization()` success case
- [ ] Test `_captureStripePreAuthorization()` failure case
- [ ] Test `_captureStripePreAuthorization()` already-captured case
- [ ] Test retry logic with network failures
- [ ] Test retry logic with rate limiting
- [ ] Test capture status verification

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Complete ride with Stripe payment (should auto-capture)
- [ ] Complete ride when capture fails (should show error)
- [ ] Auto-capture service processes uncaptured payments
- [ ] Admin screen displays uncaptured payments
- [ ] Manual capture from admin screen works
- [ ] Bulk capture processes multiple orders

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Payment intent in wrong status
- [ ] Payment intent already captured
- [ ] Stripe API returns error
- [ ] Network timeout during capture
- [ ] Concurrent capture attempts
- [ ] Order without payment intent ID
- [ ] Stripe not configured

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Dashboard Metrics

Access via `PaymentCaptureMonitor.getCaptureMetrics()`:

- Total Stripe orders
- Captured vs uncaptured count
- Capture success rate percentage
- Total captured amount
- Total uncaptured amount
- Date range analysis

### Real-Time Alerts

```dart
// Alert if uncaptured count exceeds threshold
PaymentCaptureMonitor.alertUncapturedThreshold(
  threshold: 10,
  onThresholdExceeded: (count, amount) {
    // Send notification to admin
    // Display warning banner
    // Trigger manual review
  }
);
```

### Daily Reports

```dart
// Get today's capture statistics
final report = await PaymentCaptureMonitor.getDailyReport();
print("Today's capture rate: ${report['captureRate']}%");
print("Uncaptured amount: ${report['totalUncapturedAmount']}");
```

## Admin Tools

### Access Uncaptured Payments Screen

Add to navigation/settings:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => UncapturedPaymentsScreen(),
  ),
);
```

### Manual Capture Single Order

```dart
await AutoCaptureService.retryFailedOrder(orderId);
```

### Check Service Status

```dart
final status = await AutoCaptureService.getServiceStatus();
print("Pending captures: ${status['pendingCapturesCount']}");
print("Success rate: ${status['successRate']}%");
```

## Recovery Plan for Existing Uncaptured Payments

### Step 1: Identify Uncaptured Payments

```dart
final uncaptured = await PaymentCaptureMonitor.getUncapturedOrders();
print("Found ${uncaptured.length} uncaptured payments");
```

### Step 2: Review in Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Payments
2. Filter by "Uncaptured"
3. Cross-reference with Firebase order IDs

### Step 3: Bulk Capture

Option A: Use admin screen
1. Open `UncapturedPaymentsScreen`
2. Review list of pending payments
3. Click "Bulk Capture" button

Option B: Programmatic capture
```dart
final uncaptured = await PaymentCaptureMonitor.getUncapturedOrders();
for (final order in uncaptured) {
  await AutoCaptureService.retryFailedOrder(order['id']);
}
```

### Step 4: Verify Results

```dart
final metrics = await PaymentCaptureMonitor.getCaptureMetrics();
print("Capture rate: ${metrics['captureRate']}%");
print("Remaining uncaptured: ${metrics['uncapturedOrders']}");
```

## Preventive Measures

### 1. Capture Verification

Before marking ride as complete:
- ✅ Verify payment intent status is "succeeded"
- ✅ Check transaction record created
- ✅ Confirm Firestore updated

### 2. Status Monitoring

Enable real-time monitoring:
```dart
PaymentCaptureMonitor.streamUncapturedPayments().listen((payments) {
  if (payments.length > 5) {
    showAdminAlert("${payments.length} payments awaiting capture");
  }
});
```

### 3. Regular Audits

Schedule weekly checks:
- Review capture failure logs
- Analyze capture success rate trends
- Investigate failed capture patterns
- Update retry logic if needed

## Configuration

### Auto-Capture Interval

Default: 15 minutes

To change:
```dart
// In main.dart
AutoCaptureService.startAutoCapture(
  interval: const Duration(minutes: 30), // Change to 30 minutes
);
```

### Capture Retry Settings

Default: 3 attempts with exponential backoff

To change:
```dart
// In payment_order_controller.dart
final captureResult = await _captureWithRetry(
  maxRetries: 5, // Increase to 5 attempts
);
```

### Uncaptured Age Threshold

Default: 24 hours

To change:
```dart
// In auto_capture_service.dart
final cutoffTime = Timestamp.fromDate(
  DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 48)), // Change to 48 hours
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Capture still failing

**Check:**
1. Stripe API keys configured correctly
2. Payment intent still in capturable state
3. Network connectivity
4. Stripe API status (status.stripe.com)

**Solution:**
```dart
// Enable detailed logging
print("Payment Intent: ${order.paymentIntentId}");
print("Status: ${order.paymentIntentStatus}");
print("Amount: ${order.finalRate}");

// Test capture directly
final stripeService = StripeService(...);
final result = await stripeService.capturePaymentIntent(
  paymentIntentId: order.paymentIntentId!,
);
print("Stripe Response: $result");
```

### Issue: Auto-capture not running

**Check:**
```dart
final status = await AutoCaptureService.getServiceStatus();
print("Service running: ${status['isRunning']}");
```

**Solution:**
```dart
// Restart service
AutoCaptureService.stopAutoCapture();
await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
AutoCaptureService.startAutoCapture();
```

### Issue: Payment captured but status not updated

**Check Firestore:**
```dart
final order = await FireStoreUtils.getOrder(orderId);
print("Payment Status: ${order.paymentStatus}");
print("Intent Status: ${order.paymentIntentStatus}");
```

**Solution:**
```dart
// Manually update status
order.paymentIntentStatus = 'succeeded';
order.paymentStatus = true;
await FireStoreUtils.setOrder(order);
```
