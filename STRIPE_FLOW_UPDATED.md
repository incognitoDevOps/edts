# Stripe Payment Authorization - Updated Flow

## Overview

The Stripe payment authorization now happens **immediately when the rider selects Stripe as the payment method** in the booking details screen, not during the actual booking process.

## Updated Flow

### 1. User Journey

```
Step 1: User enters pickup and destination
        ‚Üì
Step 2: User clicks "Book Ride" button
        ‚Üì
Step 3: Booking Details screen opens
        ‚Üì
Step 4: User clicks "Payment Method" section
        ‚Üì
Step 5: Payment method dialog appears
        ‚Üì
Step 6: User selects "Stripe"
        ‚Üì [PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION HAPPENS HERE]
Step 7: Stripe payment sheet appears automatically
        ‚Üì
Step 8: User enters card details and authorizes
        ‚Üì
Step 9: If insufficient balance ‚Üí "Insufficient balance" toast
        If success ‚Üí Payment authorized confirmation
        ‚Üì
Step 10: User sees "Payment Authorized ‚úì" under Stripe option
        ‚Üì
Step 11: User clicks "Book Ride" button
        ‚Üì
Step 12: Ride is booked using the pre-authorized payment
```

### 2. Technical Flow

#### Payment Method Selection (booking_details_screen.dart)

```dart
User taps Stripe option
    ‚Üì
_handleStripeSelection() is called
    ‚Üì
1. Validates route is calculated
2. Calculates total amount (fare + taxes)
3. Initializes Stripe SDK
4. Creates payment intent with manual capture
5. Presents payment sheet
6. Stores payment intent ID in controller
7. Shows "Payment Authorized" indicator
```

#### Booking Process (home_controller.dart)

```dart
User clicks "Book Ride"
    ‚Üì
bookRide() is called
    ‚Üì
1. Validates payment method is selected
2. If Stripe: Checks for stored payment intent ID
3. Creates order with payment intent details
4. Places ride request
5. Clears form (including Stripe data)
```

## Key Components

### 1. Booking Details Screen Updates

**File:** `lib/ui/home_screens/booking_details_screen.dart`

**New Method: `_handleStripeSelection()`**
- Triggers when user selects Stripe
- Validates amount is calculated
- Calculates total with taxes
- Initializes Stripe SDK
- Creates pre-authorization
- Presents payment sheet
- Handles success/failure

**Visual Indicator:**
- Shows green checkmark when authorized
- Displays "Payment Authorized" text
- Helps user know payment is ready

### 2. Home Controller Updates

**File:** `lib/controller/home_controller.dart`

**New Fields:**
- `stripePaymentIntentId` - Stores payment intent ID
- `stripePreAuthAmount` - Stores authorized amount

**Updated `bookRide()` Method:**
- No longer creates payment intent
- Uses stored payment intent ID
- Validates authorization exists
- Attaches to order model

### 3. Stripe Service

**File:** `lib/services/stripe_service.dart`
- Unchanged from previous implementation
- Provides all Stripe API methods

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Balance

**When:** During payment authorization in payment method selection

**User sees:** "Insufficient balance" toast

**What happens:**
- Payment method is NOT selected
- User remains on booking screen
- Can select different payment method

### Payment Cancelled

**When:** User closes payment sheet without completing

**User sees:** "Payment authorization cancelled" toast

**What happens:**
- Payment method is NOT selected
- User can try again or select different method

### Configuration Error

**When:** Stripe not configured in Firebase

**User sees:** "Stripe is not configured properly"

**What happens:**
- Cannot select Stripe
- Admin needs to configure keys

### Authorization Missing

**When:** User somehow bypasses UI and tries to book without authorization

**User sees:** "Please select Stripe payment method again to authorize payment"

**What happens:**
- Booking fails
- User must go back and select Stripe again

## Advantages of This Approach

### 1. Better User Experience
- Authorization happens at logical point (payment selection)
- User sees immediate feedback on card validity
- Clear visual indicator of authorization status
- No surprises during booking

### 2. Fewer Failures
- Card validated before booking starts
- Insufficient balance caught early
- Reduces abandoned bookings

### 3. Cleaner Code
- Separation of concerns
- Payment logic in payment selection
- Booking logic in booking method
- Easier to maintain

### 4. Security
- Payment data stored temporarily in memory
- Cleared after booking completes
- No sensitive data persisted

## Testing the Flow

### Test 1: Successful Authorization

1. Enter pickup and destination
2. Click payment method
3. Select Stripe
4. Enter card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
5. Complete authorization
6. Verify green checkmark appears
7. Click "Book Ride"
8. Verify booking succeeds

### Test 2: Insufficient Balance

1. Enter pickup and destination
2. Click payment method
3. Select Stripe
4. Enter card: 4000 0000 0000 9995
5. Verify "Insufficient balance" appears
6. Verify payment method NOT selected
7. Can select different method

### Test 3: Cancelled Authorization

1. Enter pickup and destination
2. Click payment method
3. Select Stripe
4. Close payment sheet
5. Verify "Payment authorization cancelled"
6. Verify payment method NOT selected
7. Can try again

### Test 4: Authorization Before Amount

1. Open booking screen without calculating route
2. Click payment method
3. Select Stripe
4. Verify "Please calculate route first"

## Configuration

No changes to configuration. Same as before:

**Firebase (payment_gateway collection):**
```json
{
  "strip": {
    "enable": true,
    "clientpublishableKey": "pk_...",
    "stripeSecret": "sk_...",
    "name": "Stripe",
    "isSandbox": true
  }
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "stripeconfigexception" error

**Cause:** Stripe SDK not initialized properly

**Solution:** Ensure Stripe keys are in Firebase and app has loaded them before showing payment dialog

### Issue: Payment sheet doesn't appear

**Cause:** Payment intent creation failed

**Solution:** Check Stripe secret key is correct and has proper permissions

### Issue: Authorization works but booking fails

**Cause:** Payment intent ID not stored in controller

**Solution:** Check console logs for "‚úÖ Using pre-authorized payment" message

### Issue: "Payment Authorized" doesn't show

**Cause:** `stripePaymentIntentId` not set in controller

**Solution:** Ensure `_handleStripeSelection()` completes successfully

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified

1. **booking_details_screen.dart**
   - Added imports for Stripe and Firestore
   - Modified `_buildPaymentOption()` to handle Stripe specially
   - Added `_handleStripeSelection()` method
   - Updated payment display to show authorization status

2. **home_controller.dart**
   - Added `stripePaymentIntentId` field
   - Added `stripePreAuthAmount` field
   - Simplified `bookRide()` Stripe handling
   - Clear Stripe data after booking

3. **No changes to:**
   - stripe_service.dart
   - payment_order_controller.dart
   - order_model.dart

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Implementation

If you already implemented the previous version:

1. The StripeService remains the same
2. Payment capture on completion unchanged
3. Cancellation handling unchanged
4. Only booking flow is different

### Breaking Changes

- None - this is a refinement of the flow
- Existing orders still work
- Backward compatible

## Next Steps

1. Test all scenarios with test cards
2. Verify in Stripe dashboard
3. Test with real cards in sandbox
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor for any issues

## Support

If issues arise:
1. Check console for log messages
2. Look for emoji indicators (üîÑ ‚úÖ ‚ùå)
3. Verify Stripe dashboard for payment intents
4. Check Firebase configuration

## Summary

The key change is **when** authorization happens:

**Before:** During `bookRide()` call
**After:** During payment method selection

This provides:
- Better UX (immediate feedback)
- Fewer booking failures
- Clearer user journey
- Easier debugging

The payment capture, cancellation, and all other functionality remains exactly the same.
