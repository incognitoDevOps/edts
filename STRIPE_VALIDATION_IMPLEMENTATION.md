# Stripe Payment Method Validation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive Stripe payment method validation to the booking details screen, protecting drivers and BuzRyde from unpaid trips by verifying that riders have valid payment methods with sufficient funds before allowing bookings.

## Changes Made

### 1. UserModel Updates (`lib/model/user_model.dart`)
Added fields to track Stripe payment method status:
- `stripeCustomerId` - Stripe customer ID
- `stripePaymentMethodId` - Active payment method ID
- `stripePaymentVerified` - Verification status flag
- `stripeLastVerified` - Timestamp of last verification (24-hour cache)

### 2. Stripe Validation Service (`lib/services/stripe_validation_service.dart`)
Created a new service that:
- Validates payment methods against Stripe API
- Checks for expired cards
- Verifies customer status and delinquency
- Caches validation results for 24 hours
- Provides clear error messages for different failure scenarios

### 3. Booking Details Screen Updates (`lib/ui/home_screens/booking_details_screen.dart`)
Enhanced payment validation:
- Validates Stripe payment methods before allowing bookings
- Shows visual indicators for payment methods requiring setup
- Displays helpful dialogs explaining why Stripe setup is needed
- Blocks booking attempts with invalid/missing payment methods
- Validates for both instant booking and regular booking flows

### 4. Payment Method Selection Dialog
Updated to show:
- Visual indicators (warning icons) for payment methods requiring setup
- "Setup required" subtitle for Stripe when not configured
- Helpful setup dialog explaining the requirement
- Greyed-out appearance for invalid payment methods

## Validation Flow

### When Stripe is Selected:
1. Check if user has `stripeCustomerId` and `stripePaymentMethodId`
2. If missing, prompt user to setup payment method
3. If present, verify with Stripe API:
   - Card is not expired
   - Payment method is attached to correct customer
   - Customer account is not delinquent
4. Cache successful validation for 24 hours
5. Allow booking only if validation passes

### Error Scenarios Handled:
- No payment method on file
- Expired credit card
- Delinquent customer account
- Payment method not found in Stripe
- Network errors during verification
- Missing Stripe configuration

## Security Features
- Server-side validation with Stripe API
- No client-side payment method creation
- Verification caching prevents API abuse
- Clear error messages prevent user confusion
- Blocks bookings with invalid payment methods

## User Experience
- Clear visual indicators in payment selection
- Helpful dialogs explaining requirements
- Protection message emphasizing driver and platform safety
- Graceful error handling with actionable messages

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with user who has no Stripe payment method
2. Test with expired credit card
3. Test with valid payment method (should cache for 24 hours)
4. Test with delinquent Stripe customer
5. Test network failures during validation
6. Test both instant booking and regular booking flows

## Future Enhancements
- Add in-app payment method setup flow
- Implement payment method management screen
- Add support for multiple payment methods
- Send notifications when payment method expires
- Add retry logic for transient API failures
